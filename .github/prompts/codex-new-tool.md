Help extend the tools.dave.engineer repo by adding a brand new tool.

View README.md for a list of all tools, then come up with a new tool. The new tool should be simple, basic and useful. These are isolated, low stakes tools that are small enough to not need much in the way of code quality. Don't spend time refactoring.

Follow guidelines in AGENTS.md.

Once finished, summarize the new tool in your final message.
