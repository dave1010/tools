This tool uses a genetic algorithm to approximate the **shortest common supersequence** for a set of strings. Start with the prefilled DNA-like sequences or add your own. Tweak population size, mutation rate, crossover probability, and the number of generations to see how the algorithm converges.

The chart shows best length by generation, and the results panel highlights the current best candidate. All computation runs in the browser; nothing is sent anywhere.
