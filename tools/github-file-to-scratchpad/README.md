Paste a GitHub file URL to copy its contents into the Scratch Pad's local storage.

## Usage

1. Paste a link to a GitHub file (any branch or path).
2. The tool converts the link to the raw user-content URL when needed.
3. Fetch the file and store it directly in the Scratch Pad so you can open it there without copying and pasting the contents.
