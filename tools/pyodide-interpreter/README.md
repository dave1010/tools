description: Execute Python with Pyodide
category: Developer Tools
---

Run Python code directly in your browser with Pyodide. The tool loads the full
Pyodide runtime from jsDelivr and gives you a REPL-style console that keeps
state between runs.

## Features

- Multi-line editor with keyboard shortcut support (Ctrl+Enter / ⌘+Enter).
- Captures printed output, expression results, and tracebacks.
- Keeps your Python session alive so imports and variables persist.

## Usage

1. Wait for the banner to report that Pyodide is ready.
2. Enter Python code in the editor at the bottom of the page.
3. Run it with the button or the keyboard shortcut.
4. Use **Clear output** to reset the transcript without reloading Pyodide.
