Analogy Workshop helps you translate hard-to-explain concepts into vivid comparisons that resonate with your audience. Provide the concept, describe who you are talking to, and pick an angle—clarity, story, technical, or motivation. The tool calls the hosted Cerebras LLM to craft several analogies plus guidance on adapting them.

Tips:

- Mention specific pain points or misconceptions you want to address.
- Use the “Must-hit points” box for constraints such as banned comparisons or details to weave in.
- Copy the output to reuse in decks, onboarding docs, or quick explanations.
