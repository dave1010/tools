Design dramatic scenes faster with a responsive three-mode perspective grid. Switch between single, dual, and triple vanishing points, tweak the horizon, and download a polished PNG guide for your next panel, architectural sketch, or concept art piece.

### Tips

- Save multiple exports with different densities to layer complex environments.
- Three-point mode tilts the camera upwardâ€”try dropping the horizon for towering cityscapes.
- Screenshot the UI sliders alongside your PNG to capture the setup for later tweaks.
