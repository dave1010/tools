# Decay Lab

Decay Lab is a lightweight exponential decay visualizer. Adjust the half-life, starting quantity, and sampling resolution to see how material levels change over time. The chart updates instantly with gridlines and markers, and a sidebar summarizes key milestones such as when 10% or 1% remains.

## How to use

1. Set the **Initial quantity** and **Half-life** for your material (hours assumed).
2. Choose the **Observation window** and **Sample every** interval to control the timeline resolution.
3. Toggle **Gridlines** or **Data markers** for a clearer chart.
4. Review milestone timings and table rows to read exact remaining quantities and percentages.

## Notes

- The decay curve follows \( N(t) = N_0 \times 2^{-t/\tau_{1/2}} \).
- Mean lifetime and decay constants are computed directly from the half-life you provide.
