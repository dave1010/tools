## Usage

1. Paste your formatted content anywhere on the page.
2. The Markdown conversion appears instantly and is copied to your clipboard.
3. Open it in the Scratch Pad for further editing or re-copy if needed.

## Tips

- On Android, long press and tap "Paste".
- Conversion is powered by [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown), including its GitHub Flavored Markdown plugin.
- If your clipboard only contains plain text, the converter will still display it so you can keep editing.
