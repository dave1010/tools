## Usage

1. Paste your formatted content into the editor.
2. The Markdown conversion appears instantly.
3. Copy the Markdown or open it directly in the Scratch Pad for further editing.

## Tips

- On Android, long press and tap "Paste".
- Conversion is powered by [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown), including its GitHub Flavored Markdown plugin.
- If your clipboard only contains plain text, the converter will still display it so you can keep editing.
