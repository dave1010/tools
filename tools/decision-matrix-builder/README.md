Build a weighted decision matrix to compare multiple options. Add criteria with weights, score each option, and see the weighted totals update instantly.

## Tips
- Use weights like 1–5 or 1–10 for quick comparisons.
- Keep scores on a consistent scale (e.g., 0–10).
- If all weights are zero, totals will show as zero until weights are set.
