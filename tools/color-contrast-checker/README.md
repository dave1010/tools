## Overview

Quickly assess the accessibility of a foreground/background color pairing. Paste hex, RGB, HSL, or CSS color keywords to preview the combination and see the contrast ratio calculated according to WCAG 2.1.

## How to use

1. Enter or pick foreground and background colors.
2. Review the live preview to see how text appears.
3. Check the reported WCAG AA/AAA compliance for normal and large text.

## Tips

- Use the “Swap colors” button to invert the pairing and compare both options.
- Try semi-transparent colors (e.g. `#2563ebcc` or `rgba(37,99,235,0.8)`) to see the resulting contrast after compositing on white.
- Keep the preview text short and focused; longer guidance belongs in your design system documentation.
