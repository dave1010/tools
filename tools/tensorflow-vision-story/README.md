Vision Story Studio blends fast TensorFlow.js image recognition with a large language model to spark creative insights.

1. Upload a photo to run on-device classification with the MobileNet model.
2. Review the top labels and confidence scores detected in the scene.
3. Let the LLM turn those findings into a descriptive blurb plus ideas for follow-up actions.

Use it to brainstorm photo captions, marketing copy, or storytelling prompts grounded in what the model actually sees.
