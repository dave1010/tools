Inspect files and folders stored in the Origin Private File System (OPFS) for this origin. Everything runs locally using the File System Access API.

## Usage

1. Grant the browser access when prompted and the viewer lists the OPFS entries.
2. Select files to see metadata and previews, or download and delete them from the context panel.
3. Use the toolbar to refresh, create new text files, or upload files into the current directory.

## Tips

- OPFS data is origin-scoped: you will only see entries created in this browser for this site.
- Deleting files here is immediate and cannot be undone.
- Some browsers hide the File System Access API behind experimental flags; enable them if no files appear.
