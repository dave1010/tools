Quickly triage noisy console output and stack traces when something breaks.

## Features
- Automatic severity detection for errors, warnings, and info lines
- Inline filtering so you can hide noise or focus on just the red flags
- Stack trace extraction that pulls out file locations and line numbers
- Condensed "unique issues" view to see what keeps repeating
- Copy-friendly output that respects your active filters

## Tips
- Paste any console log, test runner output, or server trace.
- Toggle filters to focus on the severity you care about.
- The "Copy filtered view" button shares only the lines you are currently seeing.
